# THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED

This project was in use long time ago while [Koldy Framework](https://github.com/vkoudela/koldy-php-framework) v1 was current version. Do not use
this for any of your projects. Instead, use new framework version from (https://github.com/koldy/framework). You can find more
info on [koldy.net](https://koldy.net).

## Koldy PHP Framework

Koldy is PHP framework built for developers who wants to build web easy, fast, scalable and secure.

My target is to have PHP framework which is simple, easy, fast, well documented and based on MVC standards and I hope I'll make it even better.

Docs are on [http://koldy.net/docs](http://koldy.net/docs).
